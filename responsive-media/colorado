                    <h2>Durango, CO</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Colorado Singletrack is a high alpine, truly backcountry, cycling adventure. Riding alpine
                        singletrack above tree line
                        with stunning 360-degree views, we'll travel into the way back for a mountain bike experience
                        unique to Colorado's high
                        country. Refreshingly cool mountain summer weather greets us as we start the trip with a ride on
                        the classic Hermosa
                        Creek Trail before we meet up with the Colorado Trail, a 500-mile trail that crosses the state.
                        We ride a 72-mile
                        section of what Bike Magazine has called the, "nation's premier alpine singletrack." </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>On this tour we'll climb stunning
                        alpine passes, traverse ridge tops that glow with summer wildflowers, and for the finale descend
                        6,000 feet of
                        singletrack to the mountain bike happy town of Durango. Colorado Singletrack is designed for
                        mountain bikers with
                        singletrack experience who are in peak physical shape. Average mileage of 18 miles a day is
                        plenty at the 10,000-foot
                        elevation where the unpredictable weather could make your trip an expedition. The Colorado
                        Singletrack tour is a guided
                        mountain bike adventure not to be missed. Up for the challenge? Call us at 555-555-5555. We'll

                    <h2>Crested Butte, CO</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>If you are a singletrack aficionado (you've done Sun Valley, Brian Head and even our Colorado
                        Singletrack) and you STILL
                        want more, it's time to head to Crested Butte. Bigger peaks, taller wildflowers and more
                        singletrack than you can ride
                        in an entire summer. We have created the ultimate Crested Butte itinerary! We pedal right out of
                        town into the Elk
                        Mountains which surround Crested Butte. Located at a whopping 8,885 feet, Crested Butte is home
                        to the Mountain Bike
                        Hall of Fame and a birthplace of modern mountain biking. .</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Singletrack literally extends in all directions and we have
                        chosen the most buffed, and the most beautiful, including all the classic rides. True, breathing
                        is a challenge, but the
                        views are unrivaled making the effort all worthwhile. This trip requires singletrack experience
                        and peak physical
                        condition. Altitudes range from 9,000 to 11,500 feet. This is the real deal, and trust us, it's
                        amazing. Give us a call
                        at 555-555-5555. We'll get you lined out on the best that Crested Butte has to offer</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>By now you must have heard of it. The famous Fruita area trails including the rip-roaring loops
                        above the Colorado
                        River, Rabbit Valley, and 18 Road. These trails were created through the teamwork of local
                        cyclists, the Bureau of Land
                        Management and Over the Edge Sports. They include some great climbs and zippy descents on some
                        amazing trails such as
                        the Zion Curtain and the Overlook Trail. Both are big epic rides where you will truly appreciate
                        the support vehicle.</p>

                    <p>The Western Slope of the Rocky Mountains has forever been called, The Real Colorado. Evoking the
                        dramatic sweep of a

                        vert has given rise, not only to some extreme skiing destinations, but also some of Colorado’s
                        most treasured, if not
                        eclectic mountain towns.</p>
