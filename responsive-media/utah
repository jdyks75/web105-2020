                    <h2>Known the world over, Utah’s 100-mile White Rim Trail in Canyonlands National Park comes on like
                        a natural
                        rollercoaster, looping in and out of a multi-colored array of spires, arches, buttes, and mesas
                        carved by the Green and
                        Colorado Rivers.</h2>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p> But the added value of Canyonlands is its staggering remoteness. The closest light bulb hangs at
                        least 50-miles away.
                        Our returning guests relate that it’s this great sense of solitude, along with the fantastic
                        camping opportunities, that
                        brings them back.

                    <h2>The White Rim Trail</h2>

                    <p>A primitive trail framed by blooming cacti below, and snow-capped mountains above, the White Rim
                        Trail descends a series
                        of beguiling slickrock outcrops to its namesake, a unique sandstone pedestal. We spend much of
                        our trip riding this
                        famous off-road route and detour briefly to admire the natural landmarks, the cool Colorado
                        River, and the rock platform
                        vistas.</p>

                    <p>En route we gain a deeper, more personal appreciation for the native people who called this place
                        home as we experience
                        their beautiful, but harsh, desert home. While enjoying the beauty of the nature that surrounds
                        us, we also appreciate
                        the modern amenities a guided trip provides; with our custom support truck and attentive guides,
                        you’ll feel right at
                        home in this remote desert.</p>

                    <p>ignature switchback trails set against the great Utah outback means a trip you’ll savor for
                        years.</p>

                    <h2>Moab, UT</h2>

                    <h2>America’s newest National Monument—despite its contested status—cradles some of North America’s
                        most ancient
                        civilizations.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>


                    <p>For some, the default image of Utah’s southern tier reaches back to the raw and open American
                        frontier, the hard to
                        settle Interior West. For others, it speaks of the mystical lives of bygone, primeval
                        civilizations. Fast forward now:
                        to the feel of a nurturing sun at your back. Before you, at distance, snow-capped mountains loom
                        with an almost palpable
                        majesty. Welcome to the Abajo Mountains!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>A 1.3-million acre Bears Ears National Monument, created by President Obama in 2016—reduced by
                        85% two years
                        later—covers a broad expanse of red rock, juniper forests, high plateau, cultural, historic and
                        prehistoric legacy. The
                        latter includes an abundance of very early human, as well as Native American historical
                        artifacts left behind by the
                        first wave of Clovis people, followed by the Ancestral Puebloans, Fremont culture and others.

                    <p>A pair of monumental 2,000-ft twin buttes, the Bears Ears is the remarkable remnant of
                        200-million year old sand dunes.
                        Capped in shades of pale orange to light red sandstone, The Bears Ears formation is so
                        distinctive they can be seen,
                        even at great distance, from nearly every direction. Framed by Dark Canyon Wilderness and the
                        Beef Basin to the west,
                        Comb Ridge on the east, the Grand Gulch Plateau and Cedar Mesa to the south and Canyonlands
                        National Park to the north,
                        our mountain bike tour takes you through the most unique and historical landmarks southeast Utah
                        has to offer.</p>
                    <p>From a start at Edge of the Cedars Museum in Blanding, Utah, (pop. 3375) a 19th century Mormon
                        settlement an hour’s
                        south of Moab and Arches National Park, we climb high into the Abajo Mountains. Our ride
                        throughout the week visits not
                        only plentiful archaeological sites, but also many high mountain meadows and forests. We visit
                        gorgeous locales, such as
                        The Notch, Duck Lake, Sego Flat, Reef of Rocks, Maverick Point Overlook, Skull and Crossbones,
                        The Causeway, and Jackson
                        Ridge. Wildlife is abundant atop the Abajos, herds of mule deer bounding through spans of trees
                        while raptors dart and
                        soar overhead. During the day, views atop the Abajo Mountains extend for 75-miles in any
                        direction. At night, the
                        crystal clear skies are so bright they recast the Milky Way as near endless if not impossibly
                        dense with stars.</p>
