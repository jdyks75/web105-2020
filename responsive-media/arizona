                    <h2>Sedona, AZ</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The mountain biking in Sedona can be best described as technical, scenic and downright fun! The
                        trails around Sedona
                        were built by long ago native residents, wildlife, and more recently outdoor enthusiasts like
                        us. The trails include
                        miles of scenic terrain including cool oak tree canyons with running water, juniper and pinion
                        pine forests, slickrock,
                        rough, rocky, classic desert landscapes. The trails themselves range from well-groomed
                        singletrack and jeep roads to
                        some very rough, technical rock shelves. Around each corner you will find a new dramatic vista
                        and new places to test
                        your technical singletrack skills.</p>

                    <h2>Flagstaff, AZ</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We start our trip on the Arizona Trail which takes us through beautiful ponderosa forests on the
                        plateau above the
                        canyon. Two days in the forest brings us to the edge of the big ditch. On day three, a dramatic
                        hike into the canyon
                        offers us a new perspective of this incredible landscape. The riding on this trip is quite
                        gentle with very little
                        elevation change, making it a great opportunity to learn about singletrack. We avoid the crowds
                        along the rim of the
                        canyon and camp instead in more remote areas which we have all to ourselves. We finish the trip
                        with a ride along the
                        West Rim Drive which is closed to vehicles. This gives us a chance to visit many of the classic
                        viewpoints by bike. The
                        van is always close at hand on this trip and there is very little climbing. The rolling
                        singletrack of the Arizona Trail
                        is a great place for those just getting into mountain biking.</p>
